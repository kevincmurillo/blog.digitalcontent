# Blog Digital Content  
Free digital tools created and shared by Kevin Murillo

This repository holds the digital content I share on my blog. From time to time I create small tools, templates, and resources that help me stay organized or focused. When I think something might help someone else too, I make it available here for free.

The goal is simple. If I can create something that makes life easier for even one person, then sharing it is worth it.

## About the Eisenhower Matrix Template  
This template uses the classic four quadrant system for prioritizing tasks:

1. Urgent and Important  
2. Important but Not Urgent  
3. Urgent but Not Important  
4. Not Urgent and Not Important  

You can type directly into each section if you open the file in a PDF viewer that supports interactive form fields. Adobe Acrobat Reader is recommended for full functionality. Other apps or browser based viewers may not save your inputs correctly.

You can also print the template if you prefer writing by hand.
